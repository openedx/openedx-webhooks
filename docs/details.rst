Here are the details of what the bot does.

.. _pr_to_jira:

Making a Jira issue for a pull request
--------------------------------------

The bot gets notifications from GitHub when a pull request is created in the
organizations and/or repos where it is configured.  It's currently configured
in the edx and openedx organizations.

A number of aspects of the pull request are examined:

- The author is looked up in the contributors database
- The title of the pull request might have indicators

The bot has to choose:

- The Jira project to create the issue in,
- The initial status of the Jira issue,
- The Jira labels to apply to the issue,
- The GitHub labels to apply to the pull request.

Pull requests fall into a number of categories, which determine how it is
handled:

- If the author is "internal" to the pull request's GitHub org (as determined
  by the author's institution affiliation, and the institution's
  "internal-ghorgs" setting in orgs.yaml), the bot only applies the CLA check.
  No comments are put on the pull request, and no Jira ticket is created.

- If the title of the pull request indicates this is a blended project (with
  "[BD-XXX]" in the title), then this is a blended pull request.

- The author is checked for core committer status in the repo.  If so, this is
  a core commiter pull request.

- Otherwise, this is a regular pull request.

Additionally, if the pull request is in draft status, or has "WIP" in the
title, it is a draft pull request.

Now we can decide what to do:

- Create a Jira issue:

  - Blended pull requests use the BLENDED Jira project.

  - Others use OSPR.

  - The Jira ticket has these fields:

    - Issue type is "Pull Request Review".
    - Summary is the title of the pull request.
    - Description is the description of the pull request.
    - URL is the GitHub URL of the pull request.
    - PR Number is the number of the pull request.
    - Repo is the name of the repo (like "edx/edx-platform").
    - Contributor Name is the name of the author.
    - Customer is the author's institution, if one is present in people.yaml.
    - Blended Jira issues also:

      - have a link to their Blended epic
      - copy the "Platform Map Area (Levels 1 & 2)" field from the epic.

- Initial Jira status:

  - Core committer pull requests get "Waiting on Author".

  - Blended pull requests get "Needs Triage".

  - For regular pull requests, if the author doesn't have a signed CLA, the
    initial status is "Community Manager Review".  If they do have a signed
    CLA, it is "Needs Triage".

Draft pull requests start with a status of "Waiting on Author".  The initial
Jira status determined above will be set once the pull request is no longer a
draft, so long as the Jira issue is still in "Waiting for Author".  Note that
if a pull request is later turned back into a draft, the Jira status will not
be changed.

- Labels:

  - Blended pull requests get "blended" applied as a GitHub label and Jira
    label.

  - Core committer pull requests get "core-commiter" as a Jira label and
    "open-source-contribution" as a GitHub label.

  - Regular pull requests just get "open-source-contribution" as a GitHub label.

  - The initial Jira status is set as a GitHub label on the pull request.

- Initial bot comment:

  - Each kind of pull request (blended, core committer, and regular) gets
    different comments.

  - If the user doesn't have a signed CLA, the bot adds a paragraph about
    needing to sign one.

  - If the user has a signed CLA, the bot adds an invisible "ok to test" to get
    the tests started.

- Other information:

  - The number of lines added and deleted in the pull request are recorded in
    the "Github Lines Added" and "Github Lines Deleted" fields.

  - A GitHub status check called "openedx/cla" is added to the latest commit.
    This is applied to all pull requests, even ones by authors internal to the
    pull request's organization.


Updating Jira issue when pull requests change
---------------------------------------------

Changes to pull requests are reflected in the Jira issue.  The titles and
descriptions are copied over to the Jira issue if they are changed in GitHub.
The number of lines added and deleted are updated if they have changed.

If a change to a pull request means that a different Jira issue is needed, the
old issue will be deleted, and a new one created.  For example, if a blended
pull request doesn't have "[BD-xx]" in the title, an OSPR issue gets made
initially.  When the developer updates the title, the bot deletes the OSPR
issue and makes a new BLENDED issue for it.


Updating GitHub labels when Jira status changes
-----------------------------------------------

The bot gets notifications from Jira when issues in either the OSPR or BLENDED
project get updated.

If the change is a status change, the bot finds the pull request based on
fields in the issue. It removes the GitHub label for the old Jira status, and
adds the GitHub label for the new Jira status.


When a pull request is closed
-----------------------------

The bot leaves a comment asking the author to complete a survey about the pull
request.

If the pull request was a core committer PR, the bot leaves a comment pinging
the committer's edX champions, to help them stay current.


When a pull request is re-opened
--------------------------------

The bot deletes the "please complete a survey" comment that was added when the
pull request was closed.  The Jira issue is returned to the state it was in
when the pull request was closed.


Adding pull requests to GitHub projects
---------------------------------------

The bot will add new pull requests to GitHub projects.  Projects are specified
with a string like "openedx:23" meaning `project number 23`_ in the openedx
organization.

.. _project number 23: https://github.com/orgs/openedx/projects/23

- Regular non-internal pull requests get added to the project specified in the
  GITHUB_OSPR_PROJECT setting.

- Blended pull requests get added to the project specified in the
  GITHUB_BLENDED_PROJECT setting.

- Individual repos can specify other projects that external non-draft pull
  requests should be added to.  The projects are listed in an annotation in
  their catalog-info.yaml file:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      annotations:
        # This can be multiple comma-separated projects.
        openedx.org/add-to-projects: "openedx:23"

The bot never removes pull requests from projects.
