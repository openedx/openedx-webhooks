<summary><h3>When can I expect my changes to be merged?</h3></summary>

Our goal is to get community contributions seen and reviewed as efficiently as possible.

However, the amount of time that it takes to review and merge a PR can vary significantly based on factors such as:

- The size and impact of the changes that it introduces
- The need for product review
- Maintenance status of the parent repository

:bulb: *As a result it may take up to several weeks or months to complete a review and merge your PR.*
