I've created
[{{ issue_key }}](https://openedx.atlassian.net/browse/{{ issue_key }})
to keep track of it in JIRA. JIRA is a place for product owners to prioritize
feature reviews by the engineering development teams.

Feel free to add as much of the following information to the ticket:
- supporting documentation
- edx-code email threads
- timeline information ("this must be merged by XX date", and why that is)
- partner information ("this is a course on edx.org")
- any other information that can help Product understand the context for the PR

{% filter replace("\n", " ")|trim %}
All technical communication about the code itself will still be done via the
GitHub pull request interface. As a reminder,
[our process documentation is here](http://edx-developer-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/process/overview.html).
