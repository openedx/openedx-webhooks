### What's next?

*Please work through the following steps to get your changes ready for engineering review:*

#### :radio_button: Get product approval

If you haven't already, [check this list](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3875962884/How+to+submit+an+open+source+contribution+for+Product+Review#Does-my-contribution-require-Product-Review%3F) to see if your contribution needs to go through the product review process.

{% if is_first_time %}
#### :radio_button: Wait for tests to be enabled

It looks like you are contributing to this repository for the first time.
This means that automated tests won't run automatically, and that you'll need to wait for a test run to be authorized.

If you're experiencing a delay of two weeks or more at this step, tag the [community contributions project managers](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3548807177/Community+Contributions+Project+Manager#Current-OSPR-Project-Managers) in a comment and ask for help.
{% endif %}

#### :radio_button: Get a green build

If one or more checks are failing, continue working on your changes until this is no longer the case and your build turns green.

{% if is_draft %}
#### :radio_button: Update the status of your PR

Your PR is currently marked as a draft.  After completing the steps above, update its status by clicking "Ready for Review", or removing "WIP" from the title, as appropriate.

### When can I expect my changes to be merged?

Our goal is to get community contributions seen and reviewed as efficiently as possible.

However, the amount of time that it takes to review and merge a PR can vary significantly based on factors such as:

- The size and impact of the changes that it introduces
- The need for product review
- Maintenance status of the parent repository

:bulb: *As a result it may take up to several weeks or months to complete a review and merge your PR.*
