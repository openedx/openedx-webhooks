# Sample Open edX contributors database for testing.
#
# The key is the GitHub login.  Fields in the data:
#
#   name:       The person's name in real life.
#   email:      The person's email address.
#   email_ok:   This will be "no" if we should not send them email.
#   other_emails:   A list of other emails the user uses. This is used to help
#               identify the user.
#   agreement:  One of:
#                   "institution": this person's work is covered by an
#                       institutional agreement with edX.
#                   "individual": this person has an signed individual
#                       contributor's agreement.
#                   "none": this person currently has no agreement with edX,
#                       and so cannot contribute.
#   institution: The institution this person is associated with.  If they are
#                   covered by an institutional agreement, this should be that
#                   institution.  If they have an individual agreement, this
#                   can still be provided, for other bookkeeping.
#   committer:  True if this person is a committer, only needed if the person
#                   is not a member of a committer institution.
#   jira:       The person's JIRA login.
#   comment:    Arbitrary comment text (though why not use YAML comments?)
#   expires_on: Date when the agreement ended, meaning they have no agreement
#                   and cannot contribute.  These should be converted to
#                   "before"-style entries.
#   before:     A dictionary keyed by dates, of previous values of the
#                   information for a user, so that people can transition
#                   between agreements, but we can still examine the past
#                   accurately.
