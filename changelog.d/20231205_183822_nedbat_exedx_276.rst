.. A new scriv changelog fragment.

- When a pull request is closed, if it doesn't have a
  "open-source-contribution" label on it, it is considered an internal pull
  request.  We assume that it was processed when it was opened, and since it
  didn't get the label then, the author must have been internal at the time.
